# Full Stack open 2022 by University of Helsinki

This course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.

The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, and the use of MongoDB for storing the applicationâ€™s data.

## Part 0
Overview of the basics of web development, and also the advances in web application development during the last few decades.

## Part 1

React

We familiarize ourselves with the React-library, which we use to write the code that runs in the browser. We also look at some features of JavaScript that are important for understanding React. 

## Part 2

React, Axios

Continues our introduction to React:
- How to render a data collection, like a list of names.
- Inspect how an user can submit data to a React application using HTML forms. 

After that, focus shifts towards looking at how JavaScript code in the browser can fetch and handle data stored in a remote backend server.

## Part 3
[Repo](https://github.com/joannabec/part3-phonebook-backend)

Node.js, Express, Moongoose, Axios, MongoDB, Eslint

Implement a simple REST API in Node.js by using the Express library and MongoDB database to store the application's data. At the end of this part, we deploy the application to the internet.

## Part 4

Express, Moongoose, Axios, MongoDB, Eslint, Jsonwebtoken, Jest, Supertest

Writing unit and integration tests for the backend and implementing user authentication and authorization.

## Part 5

React, React testing library, Cypress, Eslint

Returning to the frontend, first looking at different possibilities for testing the React code. Also implementing token based authentication which enables users to log in to the application.


## Part 6

React, Axios, Redux-toolkit

Introduce to the Redux library, which is currently the most popular solution for managing the state of React applications.


## Part 7
React router, Redux-toolkit, Styled Components, Webpack

The seventh part of the course touches on several different themes. First, we get familiar with React router. After this, we look at a few ways to add CSS styles to React applications like styled components. During the entire course, we've used create-react-app to generate the body of our applications. This time, we take a look under the hood: we learn how Webpack works and how we can use it to configure the application ourselves. We also have a look at hook functions and how to define a custom hook.

## Part 9

TypeScript, Express, Moongoose, React

Using the tools previously introduced to build end-to-end features to an existing ecosystem with linters predefined and an existing codebase writing TypeScript.
